# spGRN
In order to further explore the unique characteristics of spatial multi-omics data and optimize the screening strategy for key signaling molecules, we updated and expanded the original process and developed a new spatial resolved gene regulatory network construction pipeline (spGRN).spGRN includes (ligand-receptor-transcription factor-target gene) .After multiple screenings of the regulatory network,the signal molecules were reduced, which means that overlapping common filters derived from the analysis of multiple communication tools can reduce false positive results using a single tool.
